### Background and Task

Many studies have shown that scoring functions are important in drug discovery. But one big problem is the balance between accuracy and how much time and computer power it takes. Tools like molecular dynamics (MD) and FEP+ give results that are close to experimental values, but they are very slow and expensive to run. This is why machine learning (ML) models are now being used to help speed things up [Warren et al., 2024](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/6675a38d5101a2ffa8274f62/original/how-to-make-machine-learning-scoring-functions-competitive-with-fep.pdf).

In this small project, we want to show how ML can help reduce the time and effort needed in virtual screening. While protein-ligand interactions and binding poses are very important in drug discovery, our goal here is to help participants learn how ML can be useful.

We have docking scores from XP (extra precision) docking for ~1,000 compounds. Running this docking took more than a day. Your job is to use this data to build a model that can predict the docking scores of 286 new compounds. These 286 compounds were also docked using XP mode, and that process took about half a day.

This test set contains a mix of known active and inactive compounds for a VEGFR target. Your goal is:

- To predict the XP docking scores for these 286 compounds.
- To see if your model can help find the active compounds from the mix.

This project is a simple way to show how ML can help reduce the time and cost of drug discovery. 
                
### Submission Guidelines
- Please submit a CSV file with two columns: `ChemblID` and your predicted docking scores.
- Any issue you face, Please send an email to chemoinfomaticsacademy@gmail.com
                
#### Note
- You can watch this Drug Hunter Episode [Practical Applications of Physics-based Modeling for Medicinal Chemists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xXIMfgn3h8&t=2761s) and follow the Drug Hunter Channel on YouTube
